                    I want to inform users of this
                    Service that these third parties have access to your
                    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
                    assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                    not to disclose or use the information for any other
                    purpose.

                    that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                    of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                    I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                    This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click
                    on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
                    Note that these external sites are not operated by
                    me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
                    review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
                    I have no control over and assume no
                    responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
                    practices of any third-party sites or services.

                    These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                    I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                    me with personal information,
                    I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
                    are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
                    has provided us with personal information, please contact
                    me so that I will be able to do
                    necessary actions.
					
					</p> <p><strong>Erasure</strong></p> <p>
                    
					
					You can delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your Game account. If there is any other personal information you believe we process that you would like us to erase, please email us at gomsuhn@gmail.com

You may request that we erase the personal information we hold about you in the following circumstances:

(a) you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold such personal information;

(b) you believe the personal information we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.

You can also exercise your right to restrict our processing of your personal information (as described below) whilst we consider your request.

We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case. Where you have requested that we erase personal information that has been made available publicly on the Game Services and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to try to tell others that are displaying the personal information or providing links to the personal information to erase it too.
